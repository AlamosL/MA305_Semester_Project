# MA305_Semester_Project
Image recognition is a widely used observation technique for software to identify objects or people within an image. 
Using coding methods for sifting through databases, we will be creating a Python code to recognize objects within a cameraâ€™s frame 
of reference and accurately identify the object to the user. Our goal is to obtain multiple databases of common objects from online 
sources to use as our library of reference objects. The code will identify the individual pixels of the image and then match the pixels 
to the object library. All of the objects within the frame will be able to be identified and displayed in the output. The results of 
this project will yield a Python algorithm for precise object detection in an image. 

In these files we have attempted to pull in a large file containing images which deemed successful. We have also established how to open
and close the camera for viewing purposes. Finally, some research was conducted for how we can effectively use machine learning and nuetral
networks in our code.
